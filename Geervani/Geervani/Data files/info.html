Samskrit is an ancient Indian Language.In fact, it is called the mother of all other languages.
There was a time when people used to  communicate in Samskrit in day to day activites.
But with the advent of various invasions to our land from outsiders, this language slowly disappeared from our lives.
However, it remained as a part of the religious rituals.
Since the 1990s, movements to spread spoken Sanskrit have been increasing.
The 1991 and 2001, census of India recorded 49,736 and 14,135 persons, respectively, with Sanskrit as their native language.
Large parts of the population, including children, are learning Sanskrit and are even using it to some extent in everyday communication
